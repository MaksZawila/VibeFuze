## Vibefuze

Vibefuze is a real-time, multiplayer, song guessing game.  
The application is written using:
+ Angular
+ Spring Boot
+ MongoDB

[Here](https://vibefuze.up.railway.app) is a preview of the project

## How it works

Connect to the home page where you can choose a game room of any available genre.
Then enter a nickname in order to connect to the room.
Now listen carefully, because you have only 30 seconds,
to guess the title and one of the artists of the song.
Too many? The sooner the better.
Only three of the fastest players will score more points than the others.
A single game consists of 10 rounds.
The whole game goes on endlessly... At least until an error occurs.
